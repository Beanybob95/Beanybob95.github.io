        <h2>About the Company</h2>
        <p>
          You might get the impression by reading our web site that I am
          passionate about the 2cv…<br /><br />

          Back in 1990 myself and my girlfriend Lisa (now Wife) decided to sell
          the 2 cars we had and put the money into buying one car, we ended up
          with a 2cv. <br /><br />

          We had the red 2cv (Brian) for a number of years driving it all over
          Europe, even taking it on our honeymoon.<br /><br />

          In 1993 we brought a Dyane for £50.00 (Ermintrude) to put back on the
          road and had it for a number of years. <br /><br />

          In 1995 we decided to buy a modern car and sell Brian the 2cv. We had
          the modern car for 3 months and sold it as we missed Brian so we brought
          a 2cv Van.<br /><br />

          We had so many good times in the van but decided to sell it in 2001.
          However we weren’t without a 2cv for long and then went on to have a
          number of 2cv’s:<br /><br />
        
          <ul>
            <li>Blue Special</li>
            <li>Blue and Cream Dolly</li>
            <li>Cocorico (Smokey Jo)</li>
            <li>Beachcomber (which we rebuilt)</li>
            <li>Green and White Dolly (Winny)</li>
          </ul>
