          I have excellent troubleshooting and problem solving skills, and I
          have proven to be a quick and efficient learner in my current role as
          a Technical Support Technician by rising to a senior position within my
          team. I have started self learning HTML/CSS/Bootstrap (JavaScript is
          on my to learn list) and would love to find an opportunity to work in
          the coding sector. I am looking for a company willing to give me a
          chance to learn and prove myself.

          I would like to think that this CV website, while short and sweet, is
          a good example of my current skillset. I made this page using HTML,
          CSS and bootstrap with the Visual Studio Code software, and while it
          is currently hosted directly from my GitHub directory, I am in the
          process of getting a domain and cloud host server setup. A very
          similar story for a project website that I have been working on, where
          I took inspiration from a friends company website and tried to improve
          upon it.

                  work, but I believe that the content I do have is good and my
                  skillset will only get bigger and better.

          I have spent the last 5 years working for an IT company called Oakford
          Technology, where my role involved supporting various schools across the
          county with their IT equipment, servers, networking kit and many more
          areas. I came into Oakford with no prior professional IT experience,
          and have since flourished to become a senior memeber of my team,
          learning many new skills along the way. I have enjoyed my time in a
          technical support position, but I am now venturing out of my comfort
          zone and am pursuing a career in front end development, in which I
          plan to bring the very same keen and determined attitude that allowed
          me to climb the ranks in my current role.
