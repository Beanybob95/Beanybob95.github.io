        I have excellent troubleshooting and problem solving skills, and I
        have proven to be a quick and efficient learner in my current role as
        a Technical Support Technician by rising to a senior position within my
        team. I have started self learning HTML/CSS/Bootstrap (JavaScript is
        on my to learn list) and would love to find an opportunity to work in
        the coding sector. I am looking for a company willing to give me a
        chance to learn and prove myself.

      <div class="container-fluid about_me_content_2 text_grey">
        I would like to think that this CV website, while short and sweet, is
        a good example of my current skillset. I made this page using HTML,
        CSS and bootstrap with the Visual Studio Code software, and while it
        is currently hosted directly from my GitHub directory, I am in the
        process of getting a domain and cloud host server setup. A very
        similar story for a project website that I have been working on, where
        I took inspiration from a friends company website and tried to improve
        upon it.

              work, but I believe that the content I do have is good and my

                        the
                        same time. CSS is a powerful language and I am having great fun learning the different
                        tricks and methods you can use to apply some truly beautiful looking style. I have been learning
                        vanilla CSS alongside the Bootstrap framework so that I know how to customize and build upon
                        what is
                        already there.

                        JS.
                        I am very aware that this is an incredibly powerful and versatile language, and I am very keen
                        to
                        start learning how to use it to create amazing looking content on my webpages.

                        found it very easy to use, nice and attractive when sitting down to code for long periods of
                        time,
                        and the add-ons have allowed me to customize my experience. I am of course open to learning how

                        where I had to create a website using the Adobe Dreamweaver software, so I do have some
                        background
                        education on this topic, however I admit that some of what I learned may be outdated.
